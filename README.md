# Rust

# Overview

Tuto about the basics of Rust.
First I did the tuto of GoLang. It was ok to understand but then the project was too complicated and too far of my field of application. Then I did a tuto about Javascript, which was cool and I see in it some potential application in my day to day.

Rust being a typed language can give me more knowledge and make me a better coder (as GOlang). But being less focused on the backend part of programming, it may be more intersting for me or easier to understand and apply in my day to day.

Once I complete this tuto, and maybe one project, I will decide which second language to focus on between Rust and Javascript.
